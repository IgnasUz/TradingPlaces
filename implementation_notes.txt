Some implementation descisions:
1. Generally, I would use FluentValidation for validating StrategyDetailsDto and add unit tests, but decided to go with simple static validator for simplicity
2. Included only happy path unit tests to StrategyManagementServiceTests for simplicity, generally would include all relevant tests

Total time spent: ~8 hours
1. Reviewing documentation: ~1 hour
2. Unit tests: ~1h
3. Implementation: ~6 hours
